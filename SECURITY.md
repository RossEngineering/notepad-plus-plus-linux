# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository is an active migration project and is currently in incubator status.
Security expectations are proportional to project maturity, but security issues are treated
seriously and should be reported responsibly.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open public GitHub issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

Please report privately to:

- `danross2683@gmail.com`

Include:

- affected file/component,
- reproduction steps,
- impact assessment,
- and any proof-of-concept details needed to validate.

## Disclosure expectations

- Reports should remain private until mitigation or explicit risk acceptance.
- Public disclosure timing will be coordinated after triage.

## Guarantees

At this stage, this repository does not claim production-hardening guarantees.
Security posture will be tightened as the project moves out of incubator status.
