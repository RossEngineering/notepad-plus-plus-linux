Post-RC development prerelease for the Notepad++ Linux fork.
Prepared on 2026-02-14.
Published on: 2026-02-14.

## Release gate status

- Editor UX/workflows TODO section: complete.
- Linux CI build lane: green for prerelease candidate commit.
- Release notes/checklist: complete.
- GitHub prerelease status: pending publish.

## Scope for this prerelease

1. Close the `Editor UX and workflows` section in `TODO.md`.
2. Publish a section-close prerelease per release cadence rule.

## Highlights

1. Split editor baseline:
   - no split
   - vertical split
   - horizontal split
2. Split view synchronizes on the active tab document for side-by-side editing.
3. Minimap baseline:
   - toggle from View menu
   - viewport highlight
   - click/drag navigation to reposition viewport
4. Autosave workflows:
   - focus-lost autosave
   - interval autosave
   - autosave before Run Command
5. Workspace/session controls:
   - restore previous session on startup
   - optional per-project session storage
6. Save workflow polish:
   - default `Save As` target path now starts in user Documents folder
7. Additional UX baselines completed in this track:
   - command palette
   - multi-cursor baseline

## Known limitations

1. Split/minimap are baseline implementations and do not yet include advanced per-pane command routing.
2. Minimap visuals are tuned for readability first; performance tuning for very large files continues in later tracks.

## Notes

1. Prerelease checklist: `docs/releases/v0.10.0-beta.1-checklist.md`
2. Previous baseline release: `docs/releases/v0.9.9-rc.3b.md`
