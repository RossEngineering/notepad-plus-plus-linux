# v0.9.3-rc.1

First release-candidate milestone for the Notepad++ Linux fork.
Prepared on 2026-02-13.

## Release gate status

- RC1 scope freeze: complete.
- Linux CI and sanitizer gates: pending post-tag GitHub verification.
- Distro validation matrix evidence (Arch derivatives, Ubuntu LTS, Fedora stable): complete.
- Release artifact generation/checksum validation: complete.

## RC1 objectives

1. Stabilize post-beta behavior by resolving high-impact correctness and crash issues.
2. Ensure color-coded syntax behavior is consistent across targeted lexers and themes.
3. Harden extension permission denial/approval UX paths.
4. Produce first required distro-validation evidence bundle for non-Arch lanes.

## Highlights

1. Crash/correctness fixes from beta feedback.
2. Syntax styling consistency improvements.
3. Extension permissions UX hardening.
4. Expanded distro validation across Arch-family, Ubuntu LTS, and Fedora stable.
5. In-app Help menu links for docs/wiki and bug/feature submission forms.

## Release metrics summary

- RC1 blocker count:
  - P0 open: `0`
  - P1 deferred: `1` (`RC1-B04` deferred to RC2 with documented rationale)
- Local quality gates:
  - `ctest --preset debug --output-on-failure` (`12/12`)
  - `ctest --preset release --output-on-failure` (`12/12`)
  - ASan/UBSan subset (`10/10`) with local `detect_leaks=0` due ptrace/LSan sandbox limitation
  - `./scripts/check_win32_boundaries.sh HEAD~1` pass
- Artifact checksum:
  - `44035cbfce05d4c8401e1430be0baf353148f771c3bee270c11775766539ed05  notepad-plus-plus-linux-v0.9.3-rc.1-x86_64.tar.xz`

## Known limitations (current)

1. LSP integration remains baseline in RC1; deeper diagnostics/hover/go-to-definition UX wiring is deferred to RC2.
2. Local sanitizer leak detection cannot be fully enforced in this sandbox due ptrace restrictions; GitHub sanitizer lane remains required.
