# v0.9.3-rc.1

First release-candidate milestone for the Notepad++ Linux fork.
Prepared on 2026-02-13.

## Release gate status

- RC1 scope freeze: pending.
- Linux CI and sanitizer gates: pending candidate build.
- Distro validation matrix evidence (Arch derivatives, Ubuntu LTS, Fedora stable): in progress.
- Release artifact generation/checksum validation: pending release run.

## RC1 objectives

1. Stabilize post-beta behavior by resolving high-impact correctness and crash issues.
2. Ensure color-coded syntax behavior is consistent across targeted lexers and themes.
3. Harden extension permission denial/approval UX paths.
4. Produce first required distro-validation evidence bundle for non-Arch lanes.

## Highlights (planned)

1. Crash/correctness fixes from beta feedback.
2. Syntax styling consistency improvements.
3. Extension permissions UX hardening.
4. Expanded distro validation readiness.

## Release metrics summary

- RC1 blocker count: pending final triage.
- CI status: pending.
- Artifact checksums: pending.

## Known limitations (current)

1. LSP integration is still at baseline and may require follow-up wiring for deeper editor workflows.
2. Cross-distro lanes are being promoted in stages; not all lanes may be release-blocking yet.
