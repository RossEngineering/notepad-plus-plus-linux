> **Linux-only fork notice:** This repository and its releases target Linux only. For the original Windows Notepad++ application, visit [notepad-plus-plus.org](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

Post-RC development prerelease for the Notepad++ Linux fork.
Prepared on 2026-02-14.
Published on: 2026-02-14.

## Release gate status

- Extensions ecosystem TODO section: complete.
- RPM packaging fix for extension index payload: complete.
- Linux release workflow rerun on corrected candidate tag: complete.
- GitHub prerelease status: pending publish.

## Scope for this prerelease

1. Deliver the completed `Extensions ecosystem` section as a tagged prerelease.
2. Fix RPM packaging manifest to include the installed extensions marketplace index file.
3. Publish corrected section-close prerelease after `v0.10.0-beta.5` candidate failure.

## Highlights

1. Safe mode launch option disables all extensions for troubleshooting:
   - `--safe-mode` / `--safe-mode-no-extensions`
   - in-app relaunch toggle between safe mode and normal mode
2. In-app extension marketplace placeholder with local index support:
   - bundled baseline index at `packaging/linux/extensions/index.json`
   - install/update actions sourced from local index entries
3. Extension update visibility and one-click update flow:
   - startup update notification when newer marketplace versions are available
   - update selected or update-all paths in extension management UI
4. Per-extension visibility improvements:
   - startup impact estimate
   - manifest scan timing
   - on-disk footprint summary (size + file count)
5. Packaging reliability fix:
   - RPM `%files` now includes `/usr/share/notepad-plus-plus-linux/extensions/index.json`
   - resolves unpackaged-file failure seen on the `v0.10.0-beta.5` tag workflow

## Known limitations

1. Marketplace remains local-index only; remote catalog/discovery is not implemented in v1.
2. Extension resource/startup metrics are best-effort heuristics, not kernel-level telemetry.

## Notes

1. Prerelease checklist: `docs/releases/v0.10.0-beta.6-checklist.md`
2. Superseded candidate: `docs/releases/v0.10.0-beta.5.md`
