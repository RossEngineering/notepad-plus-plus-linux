RC3 maintenance respin for the Notepad++ Linux fork.
Prepared on 2026-02-14.
Published on: 2026-02-14.

## Release gate status

- RC3b scope completion: complete.
- Linux CI/sanitizer/performance lanes: green for the RC3b candidate commit.
- Release artifacts and checksums: complete.
- GitHub Release status: published.

## RC3b objectives

1. Enable language auto-detection by default for expected out-of-box behavior.
2. Add explicit user control to disable auto-detection in Preferences.
3. Keep manual language lock/manual auto-detect behavior deterministic.
4. Align in-app bug-report links with the Linux-native issue template (`bug_report.yml`).

## Highlights

1. New `Auto-detect language` preference toggle (default `on`).
2. Automatic language detection now runs during editing when lexer is unset and lock is off.
3. Manual auto-detect action still works even when auto-detect preference is disabled.
4. Help/About bug-report links now point to `issues/new?template=bug_report.yml`.

## Known limitations (RC3b target state)

1. Auto-detect remains confidence-threshold based and intentionally conservative.
2. Advanced per-language detection heuristics remain a post-1.0 optimization track.
