Second Linux-native alpha milestone for the Notepad++ Linux fork.

## Highlights

- Completed migration roadmap through **Phase 8** (quality/performance plus developer UX/documentation).
- Added broader automated quality coverage:
  - core text operation + undo/redo unit tests
  - encoding conversion and large-file regression tests
  - multi-language syntax highlighting smoke tests
  - Linux sanitizer CI lane for memory/UB checks
- Added performance tracking baseline:
  - startup and typing benchmark harness
  - documented baseline snapshot for regression comparison
- Completed developer UX/documentation milestone:
  - Linux-first `BUILD.md`
  - one-command Manjaro setup script + guide
  - roadmap document with milestone timeline
  - migration label taxonomy + issue templates + label sync workflow
  - migration progress dashboard in `README.md`

## Included in this release

- Linux shell executable: `notepad-plus-plus-linux`
- Release artifact pipeline:
  - `.tar.xz` payload
  - `.sha256` checksum
  - optional `.asc` signatures when GPG secrets are configured

## Known limitations (alpha)

- Project remains in **incubator** status (pre-1.0).
- Full upstream Notepad++ feature parity is not yet complete.
- Windows plugin ABI compatibility is not provided; Linux plugin API direction remains documented strategy work.

## Upgrade / usage notes

- Primary target remains **Manjaro-first** Linux usage.
- Validate downloads with published checksums.
- If signatures are present, verify `.asc` files with the configured release key.

## Next focus

- Complete Phase 9 automatic language detection/highlighting work.
- Cut `v0.8.0-beta.1` as the next planned release milestone.
