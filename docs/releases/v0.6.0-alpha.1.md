# v0.6.0-alpha.1

> **Linux-only fork notice:** This repository and its releases target Linux only. For the original Windows Notepad++ application, visit [notepad-plus-plus.org](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

First Linux-native alpha milestone for the Notepad++ Linux fork.

## Highlights

- Completed migration roadmap through **Phase 6** (baseline -> packaging/release foundation).
- Qt 6 Linux shell now builds and runs natively on Arch Linux derivative systems (including Manjaro).
- Added feature-parity MVP foundations from Phase 5:
  - encoding-aware open/save/reload with EOL handling
  - multi-tab editing with session restore
  - document search/replace + recursive find-in-files
  - Lexilla syntax highlighting + loadable theme file
  - external command execution workflow
- Added packaging and distribution foundation from Phase 6:
  - Arch Linux derivative `PKGBUILD` (validated on Manjaro)
  - desktop entry, icon, and MIME integration
  - reproducible release build instructions
  - release workflow with checksum/signing support

## Included in this release

- Linux shell executable: `notepad-plus-plus-linux`
- Release artifact pipeline:
  - `.tar.xz` payload
  - `.sha256` checksum
  - optional `.asc` signatures when GPG secrets are configured

## Governance and project policy updates

- Added repository ADR set and imported RossEngineering ADR snapshot for alignment.
- Added `SECURITY.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, and `docs/versioning-policy.md`.

## Known limitations (alpha)

- Project is still in **incubator** status.
- Test coverage is currently smoke-focused; deeper regression coverage is planned in Phase 7.
- No Windows plugin ABI compatibility; Linux-native plugin API direction is documented.
- Full upstream Notepad++ parity is not yet complete.

## Upgrade / usage notes

- Primary target remains **Arch-derivatives-first** Linux usage (Manjaro baseline).
- Use release checksums to verify downloaded artifacts.
- If signatures are present, verify `.asc` files with the configured release key.

## Next focus

- Phase 7: quality/performance hardening, broader regression coverage, and benchmarking.
- Phase 8: developer UX and migration dashboard/documentation polish.
