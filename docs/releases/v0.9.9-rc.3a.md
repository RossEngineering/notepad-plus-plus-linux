RC3 maintenance respin for the Notepad++ Linux fork.
Prepared on 2026-02-14.
Published on: pending.

## Release gate status

- RC3a scope completion: in progress.
- Linux CI/sanitizer/performance lanes: pending for RC3a candidate commit.
- Formatter regression and editor safety gates: pending.
- Release artifacts and checksums: pending.
- GitHub Release status: pending.

## RC3a objectives

1. Deliver language-aware `Format Document` baseline behavior for core languages.
2. Allow executable extensions to provide formatter contributions by language.
3. Preserve deterministic, fail-safe behavior (no content mutation on formatter failure).
4. Keep scope constrained to post-freeze maintenance and low-risk polish.

## Planned highlights

1. Built-in language-aware formatting baseline (including indentation-sensitive flows).
2. Extension formatter contribution wiring through `extension.json`.
3. Permission-gated formatter execution (`process.spawn`) for executable extensions.
4. Documentation alignment for formatter capability and RC3a release path.

## Known limitations (RC3a target state)

1. Formatter support remains baseline and intentionally conservative for GA risk control.
2. Advanced language-server formatting parity remains a post-1.0 track.

## Notes

1. RC3a execution checklist: `docs/releases/v0.9.9-rc.3a-checklist.md`
2. RC3 baseline release: `docs/releases/v0.9.9-rc.3.md`
