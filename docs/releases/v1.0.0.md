## Release gate status

- GA go/no-go review: complete with open gates tracked (`docs/v1.0.0-go-no-go-review-2026-02-14.md`).
- Final RC baseline: `v0.10.0-rc.4` published.
- Promotion checklist status: in progress (`docs/releases/v1.0.0-checklist.md`).
- CI continuity gate: vetoed for `v1.0.0` under approved exception (`docs/ga-gate-exception-2026-02-14.md`), with continuity log retained for operational monitoring (`docs/ga-ci-continuity-log-2026-02.md`).
- GA blocker tracker: active (`docs/ga-blockers.md`).
- External tester triage and coverage tracking: active (`docs/ga-triage-playbook.md`, `docs/tester-coverage-snapshot-2026-02.md`).
- Incubator promotion status: approved and executed at RC4 (`docs/incubator-promotion-validation-2026-02-14.md`).

## Candidate highlights for 1.0.0

1. Linux-native editing shell with Scintilla/Lexilla integration and stabilized core workflows.
2. Skinning support with built-in light, dark, and high-contrast skin bundles.
3. Extension platform v1 with VS Code language-asset compatibility path.
4. Baseline language-intelligence wiring (diagnostics/hover/go-to-definition path) and syntax-assist improvements.
5. Crash-recovery persistence, RC3 regression gating, and release dry-run/reproducibility controls.
6. Consumer install/uninstall and desktop/file-handler integration validation across Arch derivatives, Ubuntu LTS, and Fedora stable.

## Migration guidance

1. Back up user state before upgrade:
   - `~/.config/notepad-plus-plus-linux/`
   - any local crash-recovery/session files used in your workflow
2. If migrating from beta/RC local installs, run the provided uninstall flow first (`scripts/linux/uninstall-local.sh`) to avoid stale desktop or MIME registration.
3. Install `v1.0.0` artifacts for your distro path (`.pkg.tar.zst`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, or tarball flow) and verify package manager metadata resolves correctly.
4. On first launch, validate:
   - preferred skin and editor defaults
   - extension enablement state and formatter assignments
   - language auto-detection behavior for your common file types
5. Re-check desktop/file-association defaults (`xdg-mime`/launcher integration) after upgrade.

## Known limitations (accepted for GA window)

- External tester intake is currently limited; maintainer-led validation remains the primary short-term signal source (`docs/tester-coverage-snapshot-2026-02.md`).
- Any additional non-blocking distro caveats discovered during final sign-off will be appended here before tagging `v1.0.0`.

## Final validation model for GA closeout

1. Maintainer-led daily validation across available local environments through GA cut.
2. Daily issue triage pass with escalation rules from `docs/ga-triage-playbook.md`.
3. If external reports arrive, promote reproducible crash/data-loss/install defects directly into `docs/ga-blockers.md`.
4. Hold `v1.0.0` tag until `P0` blockers remain at zero and final release-operations checks complete.
