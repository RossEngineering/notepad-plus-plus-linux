# v1.0.0 (Draft)

> **Linux-only fork notice:** This repository and its releases target Linux only. For the original Windows Notepad++ application, visit [notepad-plus-plus.org](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

First general-availability release for the Notepad++ Linux fork.
Draft prepared on 2026-02-14.

## Release gate status

- GA go/no-go review: complete with open gates tracked (`docs/v1.0.0-go-no-go-review-2026-02-14.md`).
- Final RC baseline: `v0.9.9-rc.3` published; `v0.9.9-rc.3a` maintenance respin in progress.
- Promotion checklist status: in progress (`docs/releases/v1.0.0-checklist.md`).
- Incubator promotion status: re-validation complete; final promote/defer decision pending GA sign-off.

## Candidate highlights for 1.0.0

1. Linux-native editing shell with Scintilla/Lexilla integration and stabilized core workflows.
2. Skinning support with built-in light, dark, and high-contrast skin bundles.
3. Extension platform v1 with VS Code language-asset compatibility path.
4. Baseline language-intelligence wiring (diagnostics/hover/go-to-definition path) and syntax-assist improvements.
5. Crash-recovery persistence, RC3 regression gating, and release dry-run/reproducibility controls.
6. Consumer install/uninstall and desktop/file-handler integration validation across Arch derivatives, Ubuntu LTS, and Fedora stable.

## Migration guidance (working draft)

1. Back up existing user configuration and recovery artifacts before replacing any beta/RC install.
2. If using the local installer flow, run uninstall for older RC builds before installing final GA artifacts.
3. Re-validate preferred skin and extension settings on first GA launch.
4. Verify desktop/file-association defaults after upgrade in your target distro environment.

## Known limitations (to finalize at GA cut)

- Final CI continuity gate (7-day required-lane run) remains open until satisfied on the GA candidate path.
- Any non-blocking distro caveats discovered during final sign-off will be documented here.
