> **Linux-only fork notice:** This repository and its releases target Linux only. For the original Windows Notepad++ application, visit [notepad-plus-plus.org](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

RC4 consolidation release for the Notepad++ Linux fork.
Prepared on 2026-02-14.
Published on: 2026-02-14.

## Release gate status

- GA development branch (`ga-dev-week1`) merged into `master`: complete.
- Adoption and product polish section closure: complete.
- Linux CI/release dry-run gates on RC4 candidate: complete.
- Incubator promotion decision: **approved** (repository exits incubator at RC4).

## RC4 objectives

1. Consolidate post-RC3 feature and maintenance work from GA development onto `master`.
2. Close the `Adoption and product polish` TODO section as a release-scoped milestone.
3. Publish a new RC baseline for final GA hardening.
4. Record and execute incubator exit as part of this release.

## Highlights

1. Reliability and observability hardening shipped into the RC baseline:
   - startup trace capture mode
   - crash report bundle export
   - expanded performance and regression guardrails
2. Adoption/product polish scope completed:
   - first-run onboarding flow
   - opt-in settings import wizard (VS Code/VSCodium/Kate)
   - curated built-in skins (`dusk`, `solarized light`)
   - icon variants (`auto`, `accent`, `monochrome`)
   - in-app “Top Requested Features” board link
3. Packaging/install payloads updated for new skin/icon assets across tar/deb/rpm/pkg outputs.
4. Governance update:
   - repository status transitions from **Incubator** to **Promoted** at `v0.10.0-rc.4`.

## Known limitations

1. Marketplace remains local-index only in extension API v1.
2. 1.0.0 continuity gate (7 consecutive required CI green days) remains open.
3. Final GA migration copy in `docs/releases/v1.0.0.md` remains draft.

## Notes

1. RC4 checklist: `docs/releases/v0.10.0-rc.4-checklist.md`
2. Previous prerelease baseline: `docs/releases/v0.10.0-beta.7.md`
