> **Linux-only fork notice:** This repository and its releases target Linux only. For the original Windows Notepad++ application, visit [notepad-plus-plus.org](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

Post-RC development prerelease for the Notepad++ Linux fork.
Prepared on 2026-02-14.
Published on: 2026-02-14.

## Release gate status

- Formatting/language-intelligence TODO section: complete.
- Linux CI build lane: green for prerelease candidate commit.
- Release notes/checklist: complete.
- GitHub prerelease status: pending publish.

## Scope for this prerelease

1. Close the `Formatting, language intelligence, and coding tools` section in `TODO.md`.
2. Publish a section-close prerelease per release cadence rule.

## Highlights

1. Formatter profile selection:
   - default formatter profile (`auto`, `built-in`, `extension`)
   - per-language formatter profile overrides
   - persisted profile settings in editor preferences
2. Diagnostics panel baseline:
   - in-editor diagnostics list
   - severity and text filtering
   - quick navigation to diagnostic line
3. Document symbol baseline:
   - symbol outline from current document
   - symbol filtering/search
   - quick navigation to symbol line
4. Rename symbol baseline:
   - in-document symbol rename from current caret symbol
   - lexical boundary-safe replacement behavior
5. Code actions baseline:
   - quick-fix list derived from diagnostics
   - baseline actions for trailing whitespace and tab-to-spaces fixes
6. New language-intelligence action wiring:
   - `Document Symbols (Baseline)`
   - `Rename Symbol (Baseline)`
   - `Code Actions (Baseline)`

## Known limitations

1. Diagnostics/symbols/rename/code actions are baseline in-editor behavior and do not yet depend on full LSP protocol response payloads.
2. Formatter profile overrides currently use language IDs and explicit extension IDs; marketplace-driven formatter discovery is still future work.

## Notes

1. Prerelease checklist: `docs/releases/v0.10.0-beta.2-checklist.md`
2. Previous development prerelease: `docs/releases/v0.10.0-beta.1.md`
