# v0.9.0-beta.2

Second beta milestone for the Notepad++ Linux fork.
Prepared on 2026-02-13.

## Release gate status

- Phase 10 complete (UI skinning support).
- Phase 11 complete (extension platform + VS Code language-asset compatibility path).
- Phase 12 complete (hardening + language intelligence scope).
- Linux CI and sanitizer gates: pending latest workflow completion on `master`.
- Release artifact generation/checksum validation: pending final release run.

## Highlights

1. UI skinning support (Phase 10)
   - Stable skin format v1 with built-in light, dark, and high-contrast skins.
   - Runtime skin switching with persisted per-user selection.
   - Expanded visual consistency across editor, menus, tabs, status bar, and dialogs.

2. Extension platform and compatibility (Phase 11)
   - Linux extension API v1 boundaries and permission model.
   - Extension lifecycle support: install, discover, enable/disable, remove.
   - Targeted VS Code compatibility for language assets (language config + TextMate grammar ingestion).

3. Hardening and language intelligence (Phase 12)
   - LSP client foundation via `ILspClientService` + Linux implementation.
   - Syntax-aware assists: HTML/XML tag auto-close and paired delimiter auto-close.
   - Improved color-coded syntax styling for HTML/XML and Markdown.
   - Crash-recovery journal autosave + startup recovery prompt.
   - Extension startup performance guardrails with diagnostics logging.
   - Distro validation expansion plan documented beyond Arch derivatives baseline.

## Release metrics summary

- Local gate evidence (latest before release):
  - `cmake --build --preset debug`
  - `ctest --test-dir build/debug --output-on-failure` (11/11 passing)
  - `./scripts/check_win32_boundaries.sh HEAD` (pass)
- CI run URL: pending final green workflow completion for Beta 2 release commit.
- Artifact checksums: pending release artifact generation.

## Known limitations (beta)

1. LSP integration is currently foundation-only; richer editor wiring remains follow-up scope.
2. Extension performance guardrails currently report and log diagnostics; automatic policy enforcement is not yet applied.
3. Cross-distro validation matrix is documented; full required-lane promotion is staged rollout work.

## Notes

1. This release closes the planned Beta 2 scope (Phases 10-12).
2. Release execution checklist: `docs/releases/v0.9.0-beta.2-checklist.md`
