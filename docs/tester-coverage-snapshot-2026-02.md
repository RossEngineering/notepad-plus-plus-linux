## Usage rules

1. Update this file once per day during the GA window.
2. Add a row to coverage matrix only for actionable, reproducible tester reports.
3. Any crash, data-loss, save/open, or installer regression must also be reflected
   in `docs/ga-blockers.md` as a candidate blocker.
4. Keep issue URLs in notes or table cells when adding real entries.
