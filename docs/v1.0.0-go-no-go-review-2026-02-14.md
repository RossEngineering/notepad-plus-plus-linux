> **Linux-only fork notice:** This repository and its releases target Linux only. For the original Windows Notepad++ application, visit [notepad-plus-plus.org](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

- Date: 2026-02-14
- Reviewer: Codex
- Baseline candidate: `v0.9.9-rc.3a`
- Checklist reference: `docs/releases/v1.0.0-checklist.md`

## Decision

Current recommendation: **No-Go (pending final gate closure)**.

## Blocking gates before `v1.0.0` tag

1. Linux required CI lanes must remain green for 7 consecutive days on the GA candidate path.
2. Finalize `docs/releases/v1.0.0.md` and migration guidance for publication quality.
3. Record final incubator promote/defer decision for GA and align repository-status text accordingly.

## Gate-by-gate status

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RC baseline accepted | Pass | `docs/releases/v0.9.9-rc.3a.md` |
| Feature freeze maintained through RC3 closeout | Pass | `docs/feature-freeze-rc3.md`, `docs/releases/v0.9.9-rc.3.md` |
| Final blocker review (`P0 open = 0`) | Pass | `docs/rc3-blockers.md` |
| Full regression matrix | Pass | `docs/rc3-regression-report-2026-02-14.md` |
| Release dry-run/reproducibility/signing flow | Pass | `docs/release-dry-run-report-rc3-2026-02-14.md` |
| Distro desktop/file-handler validation | Pass | `docs/distro-validation-report-rc3-2026-02-14.md` |
| Data-loss/crash-recovery regression gate | Pass | `docs/rc3-regression-report-2026-02-14.md` |
| Required Linux lanes green for 7-day window | Pending | Current workflows are green, continuity window still open |
| GA release notes + migration guidance finalized | Pending | `docs/releases/v1.0.0.md` is still draft |
| Incubator promotion decision recorded | Pending | `docs/incubator-promotion-validation-2026-02-14.md` recommends readiness; final decision not recorded |

## Recommendation

Proceed with GA prep work while holding the `v1.0.0` tag until the three blocking gates above are closed.
