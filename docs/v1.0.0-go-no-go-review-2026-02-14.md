> **Linux-only fork notice:** This repository and its releases target Linux only. For the original Windows Notepad++ application, visit [notepad-plus-plus.org](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

- Date: 2026-02-14
- Reviewer: Codex
- Baseline candidate: `v0.10.0-rc.4`
- Checklist reference: `docs/releases/v1.0.0-checklist.md`

## Decision

Current recommendation: **Conditional Go (pending final publish checks)**.

## Blocking gates before `v1.0.0` tag

No unresolved blocking gates remain after the `v1.0.0` continuity-gate exception.
Final release operations checks still apply (packaging, artifact verification,
publish, and smoke validation).
