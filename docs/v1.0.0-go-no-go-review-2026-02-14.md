## Blocking gates before `v1.0.0` tag

1. Linux required CI lanes must remain green for 7 consecutive days on the GA candidate path.

| Final blocker review (`P0 open = 0`) | Pass | `docs/rc3-blockers.md` |
| GA blocker review (`P0 open = 0`) | Pending | `docs/ga-blockers.md` |

## Recommendation

Proceed with GA prep work while holding the `v1.0.0` tag until the continuity gate closes and `docs/ga-blockers.md` reaches zero open `P0`.
